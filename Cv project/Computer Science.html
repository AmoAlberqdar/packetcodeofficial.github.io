                <h2>As Short Answer</h2>
                <p>Computer Science is the study of algorithms: step-by-step procedures for solving problems or accomplishing tasks.

We can think of algorithms just as computer programs, but CS is far broader than writing programs! It encompasses the scientific study of algorithms: What are their fundamental capabilities and limitations? It also deals with the algorithmic study of science: What can we learn in, say, Biology, or Microeconomics, or Physics or Mathematics or more, by taking an algorithmic perspective?</p>

                <h2>Brief list of topics:</h2>
                <ul>
				<li> <p>Designing algorithms to solve problems (ex "Google maps": find the shortest route from A to B on a map). </p></li>
				<li> <p>"Complexity" or difficulty of problems and relationships between them (ex "Fedex delivery": find the shortest route that visits all of the many delivery locations; and "Subset sum": given a list of numbers, pick out a bunch that sum up to 100; both problems seem hard and turn out to be "equivalent" in a cool way). </p></li>
				<li> <p>Machine learning of facts or procedures from data (ex "OCR": train a comp to read handwritten zipcodes on letters). </p></li>
				<li> <p>Building systems of software (or hardware) (examples all around us). </p></li>
				<li> <p>... and much more! </p></li>

                <h2>As Long Answer</h2>
                <p>Do not ask: How high is the mountain? Climb the mountain. Then you will know.</p>
